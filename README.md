# Alien Robot Chatbot
Alien Robot Chatbot is a rule-based conversational agent that simulates an interaction with an alien robot who has arrived on Earth. The chatbot asks and answers questions about Earth and its inhabitants from the perspective of an alien lifeform. Designed to be a fun and educational tool, this project can serve as an introduction to rule-based chatbots, offering insights into how such systems are structured and how they can be expanded with more complex rules and dialogues.

### Features:
Alien Personality: The chatbot embodies an alien who is curious about Earth and its strange customs.
Rule-Based Conversations: The dialogue is driven by predefined questions and responses, ensuring consistent and engaging interactions.
Expandable Design: The project is easily extendable, allowing you to add more questions, responses, and conversational rules.
##### Example Interactions:
The alien asks about common Earth objects and customs, such as cars, clothes, and communication devices.
The chatbot can describe its home planet and introduce itself as a robot with advanced capabilities.
